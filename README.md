# Predicting melignant versus benign breast cancer cases
Predicting the probability that a diagnosed breast cancer case is malignant or benign based on Wisconsin dataset from UCI repository. 

## Libraries used
numpy, pandas, matplotlib.pyplot, sklearn.linear_model, sklearn.pipeline, sklearn.preprocessing, sklearn.neighbors, sklearn.naive_bayes, scipy

# Uses
This project will test various classifiers (logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, random forest, and others) to find the classifier that predicts the testing data with the best possible accuracy at the shortest time possible.  

First, it will examine the data looking for patterns of correlations among variables. Then it will run various classifiers and compare them. Once a number of 2-3 classifiers is identified as most accurate, the model is fine tuned again. Then, we try it again and see which model predicts data with the highest accuracy.
