## Predicting malignant versus benign breast cancer cases
Predicting the probability that a diagnosed breast cancer case is malignant or benign based on Wisconsin dataset from UCI repository. 

### Project Overview
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) breast cancer is the most common type of cancer for women regardless of race and ethnicity (CDC, 2016). Around 220,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer each year in the United States (CDC, 2016). Although we may not be aware of all the factors contributing in developing breast cancer, certain attributes such as family history, age, obesity, alcohol and tobacco use have been identified from research studies on this topic (DeSantis, Ma, Bryan, & Jemal, 2014). Breast images procedures such as mammography have been found to be quite effective in early identification cases of breast cancer (Ball, 2012).  When breast images procedures are not utilized, patients can find out late about their diagnosis to be able to treat it.  Similar work on attempting to find the best way to predict the type of cancer based on images of mammograms has identified Support Vector Machine as the best predictor after tuning parameters.  
 

#### Files in this repository
Many files in the respository are examples and things to be saved as the work progresses. Those are names examples_01 and so on. 
The file where you can find all the coding for different classifiers is called _breast_cancer_clean.ipynb_ 

##### Problem Statement
This project focuses in investigating the probability of predicting the type of breast cancer (malignant or benign) from the given characteristics of breast mass computed from digitized images.  The cases provided, are cases diagnosed with some type of tumor, but only some of them (approximately 37%) are malignant.  This project will examine the data available and attempt to predict the possibility that a breast cancer diagnosis is malignant or benign based on the attributes collected from the breast mass. To achieve this goal, the following steps are identified:
•	Download the breast cancer images data from UCI repository
•	Familiarize with the data by looking at its shape, the relations between variables, their possible correlations, and other attributes of the dataset. 
•	Preprocess data if needed
•	Split the data into testing and training samples
•	Employ various classifiers (K-neighbors, Decision trees, SVC, QDA, AdaBoost, Naïve Bayes, Random Forest, and MLP classifier) to predict the data with different sets of training samples (100, 200, 300, and 400). 
•	Once the best predicting model is identified, will reduce the training set in size to see what is the limit for this classifier to best predict these data.
•	Compare the best identified classifier with evaluation metric stated at the beginning of the project.
•	Write conclusions.

### Uses
This project tests various classifiers (logistic regression, SVM, decision trees, random forest, and others) to find the classifier that predicts the testing data with the best possible accuracy at the shortest time possible.  

First, it examines the data looking for patterns of correlations among variables. Then it runs various classifiers and compare them. Once a number of 2-3 classifiers is identified as most accurate, the model is fine tuned again. Then, we can see which model predicts data with the highest accuracy.

### Classifiers used to predict the breast cancer for a training size = 300 

Type of Classifiers | Training Time | Prediction Time| F1 score (training set) | **F1 Score (testing set)**
:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:
**K-nearest neighbor** | .0012 | .0022 | .9264 | .9081
**Decision Trees** | .0033 | .0002 | 1.000 | .9239
**SVC** | .0051 |.0029 | 1.000 |.0000
**Naive Bayes** |.0006 | .0003 |.9058 | .9341
**Random Forest** | .0381 | .0064 | 1.000 | .9101
**AdaBoost** | .1866 | .0055 | 1.000 | .9451
**QDA** |.0013 | .0005 | .9528 | .9688
**MLP** |.0084 | .0005 | .6648 | .6267


_The F-1 score measures the accuracy of the prediction. The closer it is to a value of 1, the better the prediction is._
QDA seems to work perfectly in this case compared to other forms of classifiers and it is also quite fast to train the data.

A second round of classifiers with an increase training size of 400 was attempted again.  Results are shown below:
